# Challenge-Quiz

## Overview

The Challenge is to create a timed, multiple-choice coding quiz that can keep track of high scores and quiz-takers' initials.

Purpose of this project is to create a timed JavaScript quiz, where users may save their score to their local storage after completing the coding quiz challenge by entering their initials. All the saved scores can be viewed on the highscores pageRestarting the quiz will clear the stored scores.

## Description

The quiz is made up of 5 questions
The user has 60 seconds to complete the quiz
Everytime the user selects an answer:
